so here's the plan
- page like tamu catalog, except it also has all professors w/ respective rmp links


hypothesized components
- professor_card
- ?gpa graph
- course

zcat -f access.log* | grep "aggieclasses.com" | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l
346

ssh -i ~/.ssh/"public.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-59-245-176.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
