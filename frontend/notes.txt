CONTEXT DEFINITIONS

COURSES:
    Hashmap Courses ("${dept}${number}" -> COURSE OBJECT)
    COURSE OBJECT:
        {info}
        //NOT {sections} -> for overall //note: will aggregator over professors instead of storing sections twice
        [professorsId (internal ID from mongo?)]

PROFESSORS:
    Hashmap Professors (ProfessorID -> PROFESSOR OBJECT)
    PROFESSOR OBJECT: 
        ARRAY of COURSE Hashmaps ("${dept}${number}" -> SECTIONSARRAY: [{sectionObjects}])
            sectionObjects:
                {same as in DB}


searchresults useeffects do not respect async considerations
- if you fire two comparison at the same time, one can overwrite the other
    - much weirder stuff can happen than just that
