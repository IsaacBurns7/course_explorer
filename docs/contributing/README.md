For contributers, Isaac(me) and Rafay(Co-PM) aim to make contribution as enjoyable and painless as possible.
To that end, please ensure that you do not directly contribute to the main branch, and rather create a feat/<feature> branch 
for whatever feature you're adding.
Let the team know what files you will be working on beforehand, lest we hit merge conflicts(painful to resolve).

In the case of merge conflicts, speak with either Isaac, Rafay, or the respective owner of the branch you're merging into, 
before completing the merge. This ensures you don't write over perfectly good code. 

Happy merging!
